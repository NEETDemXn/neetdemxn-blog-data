    Hey everybody! As you can tell by the blog title, I finally have 100 views on Neocities!
    Before anything, I just really want to say, thank you so much! I know this website
    is nowhere close to complete yet, but I promise it's going to be pretty epic, once it's done!    
    Anyways, I'm currently working on a crypto trading bot as a way to make *some* money while I 
    work on other things. I got banned from asking any questions on Coinbase's developer site,
    for asking a simple and detailed question. It sucks because I pondered if it was good enough
    before sending, only to get banned. Whatever, FRIENDSHIP ENDED WITH COINBASE! BINANCE.US IS MY HOMIE NOW!
    I'm going to try to fix up the index.html today, so hopefully the latest blogs will show up
    on there, instead of having to navigate to `/blog` all the time. If I don't get to it, it's probably
    because I get distracted with another project, and or applying to more jobs lol. Anyways,
    more to come! Stay tuned! Love you guys ^_^
